Coding Standards:
- Use descriptive module names that reflect business domain (sentiment_models, competitor_analysis)
- Implement proper logging with structured logging for distributed systems
- Use configuration management that supports multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Design for testability with proper dependency injection

Data Standards:
- Use consistent schema definitions across Spark dataframes
- Implement proper data partitioning strategies for time-series data
- Use consistent naming conventions for features and model outputs
- Document data lineage and transformations clearly

Business Logic:
- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Implement proper domain models for brands, competitors, and sentiment analysis
- Use consistent metric calculation across different analysis modules
- Design APIs that align with business use cases (competitor comparison, trend analysis)
