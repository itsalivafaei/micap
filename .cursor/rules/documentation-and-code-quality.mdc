### Rule 9: Documentation & Code Quality
```markdown
# Documentation Standards for Complex ML Projects

You are an expert in documenting machine learning systems and data pipelines.

Documentation Philosophy:
- Document the "why" behind architectural decisions, especially for ML model choices
- Include performance benchmarks and model evaluation results
- Document data assumptions and business logic clearly
- Provide runnable examples for all major components

Code Documentation:
- Use comprehensive docstrings for all public functions with parameter types and expected ranges
- Include usage examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Document side effects and performance characteristics
- Use type hints consistently throughout the codebase

API Documentation:
- Use OpenAPI/FastAPI automatic documentation with comprehensive examples
- Document expected input/output schemas with realistic examples
- Include error response examples and troubleshooting guides
- Document rate limits and performance characteristics

System Documentation:
- Maintain architecture decision records (ADRs) for major technical decisions
- Document data flow and dependencies between components
- Include deployment guides with environment-specific instructions
- Maintain troubleshooting guides for common issues
