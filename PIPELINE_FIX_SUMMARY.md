# Phase 1 Pipeline Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to get the `run_phase1_pipeline.py` script running successfully without errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spark Configuration Error (CANNOT_MODIFY_CONFIG)
**Problem**: 
- The script was trying to set `spark.serializer` configuration after the Spark session was already created
- Spark 4.0 doesn't allow modification of certain configurations after session creation

**Error Message**:
```
[CANNOT_MODIFY_CONFIG] Cannot modify the value of the Spark config: "spark.serializer"
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed duplicate configuration settings in `scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py` line 199
- The configurations were already properly set in `config/spark_config.py` during session creation
- No need to set them again after session creation

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py`

### 2. Language Detection Type Casting Error 
**Problem**:
- The language detection UDF was defined with `ArrayType(DoubleType())` 
- But the function was returning mixed types: `[language_string, confidence_float]`
- This caused a casting error when trying to cast 'en' (string) to DOUBLE

**Error Message**:
```
[CAST_INVALID_INPUT] The value 'en' of the type "STRING" cannot be cast to "DOUBLE"
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed the UDF return type from `ArrayType(DoubleType())` to `StructType` with proper field types
- Updated the column extraction to use struct field access (`col("lang_detection.language")`)
- Fixed the wrapper function to return a proper tuple

**Files Modified**:
- `src/spark/preprocessing.py`

### 3. StringType Import Scope Error
**Problem**:
- Redundant import statements caused scoping issues with `StringType` in the UDF registration
- Nested imports were conflicting with the module-level imports

**Error Message**:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'StringType' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed redundant nested import statement in the `_register_udfs` method
- Relied on the module-level imports already available

**Files Modified**:
- `src/spark/preprocessing.py`

## Results

### Pipeline Success Metrics
- ✅ Spark session creation: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Data ingestion: **SUCCESSFUL** 
- ✅ Text preprocessing with language detection: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Feature engineering: **SUCCESSFUL** 
- ✅ Data saving: **SUCCESSFUL**

### Output Data Generated
- **129,137 records** processed successfully
- **pipeline_sample/**: Sample data extracted
- **pipeline_preprocessed/**: Text preprocessing completed  
- **pipeline_features/**: Feature engineering completed
- **pipeline_feature_stats/**: Feature statistics generated

### Performance
- Multiple successful runs with different sample sizes (0.1, 0.05)
- Proper checkpoint and recovery functionality working
- Memory configuration optimized for the system

## Technical Details

### Language Detection Enhancement
The language detection UDF now properly handles:
- **Mixed return types**: Language code (string) and confidence (float)
- **Proper struct access**: Using dot notation for field access
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unknown languages

### Memory Configuration  
The Spark configuration is optimized for:
- **Driver memory**: 8GB for processing large datasets
- **Executor memory**: 6GB for distributed processing
- **Adaptive execution**: Enabled for query optimization

### Error Recovery
The pipeline includes:
- **Checkpoint system**: Save/resume capability for long-running jobs
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Continue processing if optional features fail
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed progress and error tracking

## Running the Pipeline

### Basic Usage
```bash
cd /Users/ali/Documents/Projects/micap
/Users/ali/Documents/Projects/micap/.venv/bin/python scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py
```

### With Options
```bash
# Custom sample size
python scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py --sample 0.05

# Disable checkpoints
python scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py --no-checkpoints

# Resume from checkpoint
python scripts/run_phase1_pipeline.py --resume
```

## Conclusion
All major blocking issues have been resolved. The Phase 1 pipeline now runs consistently and successfully processes the sentiment analysis data through all stages from ingestion to feature engineering.
